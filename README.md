# calibre-arxiv

## Description

This is a plugin for [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) that allows you to
download metadata and covers for papers from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).

This project was initially developed to assist in managing academic papers within Calibre, tailored to my needs. As such, it may not encompass all the features that could be beneficial to a wider audience. I am actively seeking feedback and suggestions to enhance its functionality and user experience.
